# Weather-App

The Weather App allows a user to enter a city and view current weather conditions, date, and time.

## Installation

The application will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The app uses the Open Weather API to retrieve weather data for cities.

## Usage

When a user enters a city name in the search bar and clicks the search button, the app will display the current weather conditions for that city. The app will also display the city name, date, time, temperature, real feel temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Additionally, the app will display an icon representing the current weather conditions. The app will allow users to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature display.
